# RecursionError in Recursive Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python involving recursive functions. The function `my_function` calculates the sum of numbers from 0 to `x`.  However, it lacks a proper base case for larger inputs, leading to a `RecursionError`. The solution demonstrates how to properly implement the recursion with appropriate base cases.
